v1.1 First Feedback Tweaks
Some changes made after initial feedback from my cosplay buddy.

- Changed LED colours behind orange hats to not just saturate as red.  Added notes to README.MD regarding changing colours for your own implementation as not everyone has the same LED hat setup.
- The crank knob now acts as an independent volume control (only active when held).  This also works in idle Bluetooth mode for the pack body.
- Fixed idle mode to ensure it loads default volume settings.
- Reduced the maximum "minimum" on the powercell animation to stop it saturating when at full speed (and keep a bit of a blip).
- Due to issues with leaving the pack on and draining battery, added a light blue pulsing colour on the top front LED on the wand.
- Changed the overheat warning and venting on the wand to have the rear top LED flash, and the vent crackle blue.
- Due to the placement of the display and the handle, I modified the back plate to move it over as much as I could while not changing the back box itself.  I also right justified all text so it is easier to see past the wand handle.
- Added customisation options for overheat mode.  The time for both overheat warning starting, and the length of the warning can now be customised.  This can be saved to the SD card.  The default values have been dropped slightly.

v1.0 Initial Release
